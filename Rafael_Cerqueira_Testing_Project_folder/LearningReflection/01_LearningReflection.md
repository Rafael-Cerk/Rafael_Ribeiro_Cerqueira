## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
-
I think this project was very important because most times we learn the teorical part in the university but we don't realy teste it. If we don't test our knowledge, we can't work in real life projects and most of the times we learn better by trying and practicing.
